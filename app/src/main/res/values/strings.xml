    <string name="article_text">A severe thunderstorm warning for heavy rainfall and damaging winds for the NSW east coast, including the Sydney metropolitan area, has been issued by the Bureau of Meteorology.
\n\nSevere thunderstorms are likely to produce heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding and damaging winds in the warning area over the next several hours," the bureau said in a bulletin at 11.31am.
\n\nLocations which may be affected include <b>Newcastle</b>, <b>Gosford</b>, <b>Sydney</b>, <b>Wollongong</b>, <b>Canberra</b>, <b>Goulburn</b> and <b>Tamworth</b>.
\n\nMeanwhile, power has been restored to thousands of properties after wild weather hit parts of Sydney overnight.
\n\nMore than 40,000 properties were left without power and a number of major roads were flooded as severe thunderstorms moved across the city on Thursday evening.
\n\nPower has since been restored to most properties but, as of Friday morning, 750 remained without power, Endeavour Energy said in a statement.</string>
